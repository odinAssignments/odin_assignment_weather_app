# weather_app
This weather app was built as part of an assignment from The Odin Project.

## Description
This project was created to practice vanilla frontend development using basic JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, as well as to improve my UI/UX design skills.
It is a simple weather app that displays the weather based on the city you enter.
